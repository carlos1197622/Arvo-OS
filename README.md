Arvo OS is a powerful, decentralized, modular framework for building the next generation of blockchain-native applications. Built for those who move relentlessly forward, Arvo OS blends swarm intelligence, AI agents, and cross-chain capabilities into a unified, battle-tested system.

Leveraging a high-performance Julia backend and a TypeScript/Python framework, Arvo OS is engineered for scalable DApp creation, intelligent trading automation, and seamless multi-chain operation.

Overview

Arvo OS provides:

A Command Line Interface (CLI) for rapid deployment.

Framework APIs for custom implementations.

Cross-chain support (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BSC, and more).

AI-powered agents and swarms optimized with multiple algorithms (DE, PSO, GA, ACO, GWO, WOA, DEPSO).

Modular architecture for easy extension and scalability.

Comprehensive support for decentralized storage (Arweave, IPFS) and DEX operations.

Backed by real implementations, Arvo OS empowers developers to achieve multi-objective optimization, intelligent trading strategies, and secure cross-chain token operations.

Core Features

Agent Systems: Specialized agents for trading, monitoring, arbitrage, liquidity management.

Swarm Intelligence: Real optimization algorithms with hybrid multi-objective solutions.

Blockchain Integration: Full multi-chain support with real blockchain interactions.

Cross-Chain Bridges: Integration with Wormhole, LayerZero, Axelar.

DEX Operations: Real-time DEX quotes, liquidity tracking, slippage protection.

Portfolio Optimization: Dynamic rebalancing, risk control, and tax efficiency tools.

Wallet Integrations: Hardware wallet support, transaction signing, nonce management.

Security Infrastructure: Role-based access control, input validation, encrypted storage.

LLM & AI Integrations: Seamless access to OpenAI, Claude, Llama, Cohere, Gemini models.

LangChain Integration: Custom toolkits and agents with memory, retrieval, and AI chaining.
